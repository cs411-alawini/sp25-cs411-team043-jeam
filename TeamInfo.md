## Project Summary

Our project is an RSO Matching App that will help students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign find which Registered Student Organizations (RSO) are best for them based on several factors. The application will take in user data and be able to compare it to a database about all active RSOs on campus to find the optimal match for students. The app will be an organized way for students to explore new opportunities on campus without being overwhelmed by the number of options available. Our RSO Matching App will provide information on regular general meetings for organizations and a point of contact for new members. Overall we want to minimize barriers to getting involved on campus and streamline the RSO selection process.
